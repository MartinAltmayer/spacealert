This is a simple to use and highly configurable mission generator for the Space Alert board game. By default missions will be printed in a format that can be inserted into the Flash app at http://www.phipsisoftware.com/SpaceAlert.html.

Simply use
> python3 spacealert.py -p 4
to generate a 4-player mission.

If you use Linux and have xsel installed, you can simply use the spacealert binary:
>./spacealert -p 4
will copy the script for a 4-player mission to clipboard, without printing it.

Use
> python3 spacealert.py --help
to get an overview of options.
